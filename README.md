# From_Ice_to_Insights

ðŸ§Š From Ice to Insights â€“ NHL Analytics Pipeline
This project simulates a production-level data pipeline using Microsoft Fabric to process, transform, and analyse NHL game data. It implements a Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold) for ingestion, transformation, and visualisation, enabling faster, data-driven insights into player and team performance.

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources
- **CSV Data (Azure Blob Storage):** Simulated raw game and player datasets from Kaggle representing production ingestion

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Platform:** Microsoft Fabric, Azure
- **Storage:** Delta Lakehouse, Azure Blob Storage
- **Processing Enging:** PySpark, SQL Analytics Endpoint
- **Data Quality & Validation:** Great Expectations  
- **Security & Compliance:** RBAC, OneLake Security, RLS/CLS, Data Masking
- **Visualisation**: Power BI

---

## ðŸ”„ Pipeline Workflow
-- **Azure Blob to Landing Zone:** Full load to raw landing zone partitioned by pipeline execution date
-- **Landing Zone to Bronze Layer:** SCD Type 1 and incremental load to Delta format
-- **Bronze Layer to Silver Layer:** Incremental load only. Cleaned exact copy of bronze layer
-- **Silver Layer to Gold Layer:** SCD Type 2 to capture data evolution and incremental load

---

## ðŸ§© Architecture
Medallion Layers:
Bronze Lakehouse (Landing Zone): Ingest raw CSV data from Azure Blob Storage
Silver Lakehouse (Processed Zone): Cleanse, transform, and standardise data into relational schema
Gold Lakehouse (Analytics Zone): Model facts and dimensions for Power BI visualisation
Environment: Dev â†’ Test â†’ Prod

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Automated Orchestration: Parameterised ingestion and dynamic partitioning
Data Quality: Fault-tolerant, idempotent, and deduplication-enabled workflows
Scalability: Supports incremental and upsert-based loading
Data Lineage: Partitioned landing zone for CDC and SCD Type 2 tracking
Observability: Error alerts, logging, and pipeline recovery
Security: RLS/CLS, masking, and role-based access
